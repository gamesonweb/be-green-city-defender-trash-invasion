I have taken a cartoony approach to the contest's theme.  
The concept of this game is as follows: Our hero alien has come to earth to fight the evil trash mosters that invaded the city ! The trash monsters will be throwing trash in the city and trying to hit the alien with the trash. But thanks to the Tree-O-nator that the alien has, he will be able to change the trash monsters into trees !

Controls : zqsd for moving space for shooting
